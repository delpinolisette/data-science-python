# Statistics
Implementations of important measures and algorithms from scratch. 

The motivation for the implementations from scratch is that these are great ways to describe large amounts of data, and implementing them by hand is the best way to understand how they work. 

These functions can also be found in my python module `statistics`, and can be imported for any project. 

# Central Tendencies


Mean:
- sum of data divided by amount of data points:
```python
def mean()
```
