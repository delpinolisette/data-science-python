# Deep Learning

- originally referred to the depth of neural networks (so deep learning referred to neural networks with more than one layer)
- now encompasses all sorts of neural architectures

# Tensors

analogy: 
- vectors represented by "1D arrays"
- matrices represented in computers as "2D arrays"
then, 
- tensors represented in computers as "N-dimensional arrays"
    - not so simple, the true mathematical definition of tensor is something similar to but not exactly n-dimensional arrays
    - but this is the representation we will work with in the computer

- best practice to implement tensors from scratch to ovverride python arithmetic operators, but for now we can use `list` to represent them.
